# Hermetic FHE

A gRPC API for Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Zama's TFHE-rs library.

## Overview

This project provides a gRPC service that enables secure computation on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It's built using:

- [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) - A Rust implementation of gRPC
- [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs) - A Pure Rust implementation of the TFHE scheme for boolean and integer arithmetics

## Features

- Key generation with configurable security parameters
- Encryption/decryption of boolean and integer values
- Homomorphic operations on encrypted data:
  - Boolean operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
  - Integer operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

1. Rust toolchain (1.75+)
2. Protobuf compiler (`protoc`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hermetic-fhe.git
   cd hermetic-fhe
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

### Running the Server

```
cargo run
```

This will start the FHE service on `[::1]:50051`.

### Running the Example Client

In a separate terminal:

```
cargo run --bin client
```

This will:
1. Connect to the FHE service
2. Generate encryption keys
3. Encrypt boolean values
4. Perform a homomorphic AND operation
5. Decrypt and display the result

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test suites to verify the functionality of the FHE service:

```
cargo test
```

This will run all tests, including:
- Unit tests for cryptographic operations
- Integration tests for the gRPC service
- Tests for boolean and integer operations
- Error handling tests

To run a specific test file:

```
cargo test --test <test_file_name>
```

For example:
```
cargo test --test crypto_test
cargo test --test service_test
cargo test --test integer_test
cargo test --test error_handling_test
```

## API Documentation

### Key Generation

Generate a client key (for encryption/decryption) and server key (for homomorphic operations).

### Encryption

Encrypt boolean or integer values using the client key.

### Evaluation

Perform operations on encrypted data without decrypting it:
- Boolean operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Integer operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication

### Decryption

Decrypt the results using the client key.

## Security Considerations

- Client keys should be kept private and secure
- Server keys can be public and are used for homomorphic operations
- This implementation stores keys and ciphertexts in memory for demonstration purposes
- In a production environment, you would need proper key management and persistence
